    "Inter-pizza shop distance is important factor for pizza shop and it's users. In perspective of owner of pizzashop, lower value of mean inter-pizza shop distance can be reduce the profit of pizza shop due to competitor. However, in customer's perspective, lower value could provide more option to customers. Therefore, getting distribution of inter-pizza distance distribution is important either owners and customers. In this project, we will get this distribution and comparing it between NewYork and Toronto and check that where has more great pizza shop infrastructure."
